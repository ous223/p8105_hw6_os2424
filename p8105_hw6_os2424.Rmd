```

Based on the plot, New York, NY has the smallest estimated odds ratio and Albuquerque, NM has the largest estimated odds ratio with a larger CI.

# Problem 2

# download data
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),

    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  dplyr::select(name, id, everything())
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}

  # get log(beta1 * beta2)
  mutate(log_beta = log(tmin*prcp))
# delete NAs
boot_straps_nNA <- boot_straps|>
  na.omit()
# plot distribution of estimates
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# r.squared
boot_straps|>
  ggplot(aes(x=r.squared))+

  labs(x = "estimated r.squared",
       title = "distribution of estimated r.squared")
# log

  ggplot(aes(x=log_beta))+
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "estimated log(b1*b2)",
       title = "distribution of estimated log(b1*b2)")
```

The distribution of r^2 is approximately a slightly left skewed normal distribution. All r62 values are close to 1 which indicates that a strong linear relationship and the model we use is appropriate. \
The distribution of log(beta) is left skewed with some outliers at the smaller edge.

Based on a paper analyzing factors affecting birth weight of a newborn, I decided to use 
baby's sex, baby's length at birth, mother's weight at delivery, gestational age in weeks, father's race, presence of malformations that could affect weight, mother's age at delivery, average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, and mother's weight gain during pregnancy as factors to propose a model for birth weight. \

paper reference: Metgud CS, Naik VA, Mallapur MD. Factors affecting birth weight of a newborn--a community based study in rural Karnataka, India. PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e40040. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0040040
```{r}
#Propose a regression model for birthweight
m1 <- birthwt|>
  lm(bwt ~ babysex + blength+ gaweeks + frace+malform + momage + smoken + wtgain, data = _)
# show a plot of model residuals against fitted values
birthwt|>
  add_predictions(m1)|>
  add_residuals(m1)|>
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid))+
  geom_point()
```

Based on the plot, there is no relationship between the residuals and fitted values. 

```{r}
# compare model to two others
m2 <- birthwt|>
  lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = _)
m3 <- birthwt|>
  lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = _)
# cross-validated prediction error
cv <- crossv_mc(birthwt, 100)|>
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))|>
  mutate(
    f1  = map(train, ~m1),
    f2  = map(train, ~m2),
    f3  = map(train, ~m3))|> 
  mutate(
    rmse_1 = map2_dbl(f1, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)),
    rmse_2 = map2_dbl(f2, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)),
    rmse_3 = map2_dbl(f3, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)))
cv|> 
  dplyr::select(starts_with("rmse"))|> 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") |> 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

Based on the plot, the intersection model is the best one with the smallest RMSE. The proposed model is better than the main model, which has the largest RMSE.
